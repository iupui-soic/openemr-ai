Chief Complaint
The patient presents with a bad cough and shortness of breath for the past few days.

History of Present Illness

The patient reports that his symptoms began approximately three days ago with a runny nose. This has progressed to increased coughing and feeling tired when walking. The cough is productive of "quite a bit" of thick, white mucus, which is worse in the mornings. He notes the mucus may be "a little yellow" this time, which is typical for him when he has a cold. He denies any hemoptysis (blood), fever, chills, or chest pain. The patient notes he has been getting this type of cough "on and off for years" and sometimes experiences a "little whistling noise" when breathing.

A physical exam was not documented for this encounter. The most recent vitals on file (from 2016-02-07) are as follows:
Heart Rate: 72 bpm
Respiration Rate: 15 breaths/min
Height: 182.10 cm
BMI: 28.02
Pulse Oximetry: A pulse oximetry test was planned for this visit; no result is documented.

Laboratory and Diagnostic Studies
No laboratory results were available for this encounter.
Spirometry: This test was performed during the visit to measure lung function. Results are pending.
Chest X-ray: This was discussed as a potential future test.

Hospital Course or Assessment and Plan

Assessment: The patient is a 52-year-old male with a 40-year history of heavy smoking who presents with a 3-day history of productive cough and shortness of breath, consistent with an exacerbation of a chronic cough. Symptoms are worse in the morning. Given the chronic, recurrent nature of the cough, wheezing, and significant smoking history, there is a strong possibility of early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), specifically chronic bronchitis. A definitive diagnosis requires confirmation of airflow limitation via spirometry. Other potential causes include asthma or heart-related problems.

Plan:

Medications

NEW: The patient was prescribed a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler to be used as needed (PRN) for shortness of breath or coughing fits.

CONTINUE: The patient's ongoing medications include Clopidogrel 75 MG Oral Tablet, Simvastatin 20 MG Oral Tablet, 24 HR metoprolol succinate 100 MG Extended Release Oral Tablet, and Nitroglycerin 0.4 MG/ACTUAT Mucosal Spray.

Diagnostics: The patient underwent spirometry and pulse oximetry testing. A chest X-ray may be considered later to rule out infections or other causes.

Patient Education and Counseling
Smoking Cessation: The importance of smoking cessation was heavily emphasized as the most effective step to prevent further lung damage. Options including nicotine patches, medications, and counseling programs were offered.
Hydration: The patient was advised to stay hydrated to help loosen mucus.
Irritant Avoidance: The patient was counseled to avoid outdoor pollution and strong odors that can irritate the lungs.
Activity: Light activity, such as walking, is fine. A pulmonary rehabilitation plan may be discussed once test results are available.

Discharge Instructions
The patient was instructed to use the new short-acting bronchodilator inhaler as needed for shortness of breath or coughing. He was advised to drink plenty of fluids and avoid lung irritants like pollution and strong odors.

Follow-Up
The patient will schedule a follow-up visit in one week to review the spirometry results and discuss long-term treatment.
