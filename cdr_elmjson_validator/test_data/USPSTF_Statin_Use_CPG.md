# USPSTF Recommendation: Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults

## Source
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
Published: August 2022

## Recommendation Summary

The USPSTF recommends that clinicians prescribe a statin for the primary prevention of CVD for adults aged 40 to 75 years who have 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater.

**Grade: B recommendation**

## Population

Adults aged 40 to 75 years

## Risk Factors (must have 1 or more)

- Dyslipidemia
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Smoking

## 10-Year CVD Risk Threshold

- **10% or greater**: Recommend statin therapy (Grade B)
- **7.5% to less than 10%**: Selectively offer statin therapy (Grade C)

## Exclusions

The following patients should be excluded from this recommendation:

1. Patients with existing cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention)
2. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
3. Patients with LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL
4. Patients already on statin therapy
5. Pregnant or breastfeeding women
6. Patients with contraindications to statin therapy

## Key Clinical Logic

1. **Age Check**: Patient must be between 40-75 years old
2. **Risk Factor Check**: Patient must have at least one of:
   - Dyslipidemia (elevated LDL, low HDL, or elevated total cholesterol)
   - Type 2 Diabetes
   - Hypertension (BP ≥140/90 or on antihypertensive medication)
   - Current smoking status
3. **CVD Risk Calculation**: Use validated risk calculator (e.g., ASCVD Pooled Cohort Equations)
4. **Risk Threshold**: 10-year CVD risk ≥10%
5. **Exclusion Check**: Verify patient doesn't meet exclusion criteria

## Expected CDS Behavior

When all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria apply:
- Display recommendation to consider statin therapy
- Provide patient education materials
- Document shared decision-making discussion
