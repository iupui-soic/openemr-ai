## Recommendation Summary

The USPSTF recommends screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity. Clinicians should offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions.

**Grade: B recommendation**

## Population Criteria

### Age Range
- **Minimum age**: 35 years
- **Maximum age**: 70 years

### Required Risk Factor
- **BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²** (overweight or obese)
- For Asian American patients, consider screening at BMI ≥ 23 kg/m²

## Inclusion Criteria (ALL must be met)

1. Age 35-70 years (inclusive)
2. BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² (or ≥ 23 for Asian patients)

**Logic**: Age criteria AND BMI criteria (not OR)

## Exclusion Criteria

The following patients should be excluded:

1. Patients already diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes
2. Patients currently on diabetes medications
3. Patients with recent HbA1c or fasting glucose results

## Gender Considerations

- **Both males and females** should be screened
- There is NO gender-based exclusion for diabetes screening
- Screening applies equally to all genders

## Additional Risk Factors (for clinical consideration)

While the primary criterion is BMI, clinicians may consider earlier or more frequent screening for patients with:
- Family history of diabetes
- History of gestational diabetes
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- High-risk race/ethnicity (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidemia
- History of cardiovascular disease

**Note**: Hypertension alone is NOT a primary inclusion criterion for USPSTF diabetes screening. The primary criterion is overweight/obesity.

## Recommended Tests

When screening criteria are met, order one of:
- Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
- HbA1c
- Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

## Expected CDS Behavior

### Correct Implementation Should:
1. Check age is between 35-70 years
2. Check BMI ≥ 25 (or ≥ 23 for Asian patients)
3. Use AND logic: (Age criteria) AND (BMI criteria)
4. Screen ALL genders equally
5. Exclude patients with existing diabetes diagnosis
6. Recommend appropriate screening tests

### Common Implementation Errors:
1. Using wrong age range (e.g., 45-75 instead of 35-70)
2. Using OR logic instead of AND for inclusion criteria
3. Using hypertension instead of BMI as primary risk factor
4. Excluding patients based on gender
5. Missing BMI check entirely
6. Not excluding patients with existing diabetes
